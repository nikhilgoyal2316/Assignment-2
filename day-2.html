    <p class="j">If you’re a coffee lover, coffee geek, coffee nerd, or just someone looking for more information about coffee, here are my favorite online coffee resources. Brew a fresh batch and start reading. </p>
    <br><h3 class="i">1.Sprudge</h3><br>
    <p class="j">Sprudge is a site devoted to coffee news and culture, and you’ll get everything from updates on new coffee shop openings to coverage of coffee culture in far-off places, like Iran. They also run a site called Sprudge Wire, where they round up coffee news from around the web all in one place — a great resource if you want to know what’s happening in the world of coffee, and who is writing about it. (In full disclosure, I am a Sprudge contributor, so I am of course 100 percent biased in making this a daily morning visit to read what’s new.)</p>
    <br><h4 class="i">2. Daily Coffee News</h4><br>
    <p class="j">Daily Coffee News is a website run by Roast Magazine. It’s more geared toward coffee professionals than the average coffee drinker, but it’s full of news related to the coffee world — with a big focus on sustainability.</p>
